2. The program will ask you to select a mathematical operation:
   - Type `1` for addition
   - Type `2` for subtraction
   - Type `3` for multiplication
   - Type `4` for division
3. Enter two numbers for the operation.
4. The result will be displayed. To perform another calculation, simply follow the same process.
5. Type `"exit"` at any point to quit the program.

## Example

```
Enter first number: 5
Enter type of math operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division):
1
Enter second number: 10
Result: 15
```
